======================
* A '|' must be preceded and followed by at least one ' ', for example:
	$ ls | cat

* There is no hardcoded limit on the length of a single line, nor on the number
  of pipes a line can contain.

* To create or redefine an exisiting environmental variable the syntax is:
	$ # This creates a new variable
	$ MYVAR=ThisIsAValue
	$ # This modifies PATH by prepending the value of $HOME
	$ PATH=$HOME:$PATH

** To export an existing shell variable to its environment (so that child
   processes receive them) the syntax is:
    $ export varname



		sblibc
=====================
* malloc/realloc/calloc are implemented with sbrk.
	NOTE: Currently uses a global state variable defined in libc/malloc.c and
	therefore the library is only functional as a static library.

* printf
	supports the formats: %c, %d, %ld, %lo, %lu, %lx, %p, %o, %u, %x, and %%

* scanf
    supports the formats: %c, %d, %s, and %x
    supports having multiple in format, for example:
        scanf("%s %d", string, &integer);
    NOTE: %x does not support having a leading "0x" in front of the hex value.
